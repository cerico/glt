[âˆš] Only refreshes or direct links in dev. Fixed, can now refresh and direct link in production

[ ] Fix back button bug!

[ ] Show which link is active in sidebar

[ ] Show Time/Date of each article in feed, not just bog standard list

[ ] Think about nicer urls

[ ] General Look and Feel

[ ] No work done on small screen view

[ ] No error handling yet

[ ] Normally would use https in production but feeds are http only

[ ] General tidy up
